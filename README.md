# Codecademy Life Expectancy and GDP Project
 
This it the repository for my Codecademy.com Life Expectancy and GDP project. The project objectives are:

* Complete a project to add to your portfolio
* Use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations
* Become familiar with presenting and sharing data visualizations.
* Preprocess, explore, and analyze data.

## Looking at the data
The data was provided by Codecademy and is in a file called `all_data.csv`. The columns in the file are `Country`, `Year`, `Life Expectancy at Birth (years)`, and `GDP`. There are six countries that are listed in this dataset:
* Chile
* China
* Germany
* Mexico
* United States of America
* Zimbabwe

The `Year` column is the year for the corresponding Life Expectancy and GDP. `Life Expectancy at Birth (years)` contains the number of years that a baby born in that year would be expected to live. `GDP` lists the *gross domestic product* for the given country in the given year. Gross domestic product is the total value of goods and services produced by a country in a year.
